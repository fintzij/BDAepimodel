- Deprecated subject level bookkeeping matrix in favor of a combined subject-level and population          -level bookeeping matrix. 
- Reconsider whether to have a single row or multiple rows for the configurations at times t0 and tmax.

- Re-wrote rate extraction function to make rates available for use without a rate evaluation fcn. 
  + Rate functions always take their 'state' argument as a matrix, and their parameters argument as a vector. 
- Tomorrow: function to generate next event times. the function should inspect the current configuration and generate a new event time for each possible transition for each subject. Next event times should be stored as several vectors, or possibly as a matrix with impossible transitions recieving an Inf entry. 

General to-do:
- Re-consider how to do the bookkeeping for the simulation function. The best option seems to be to compute the vector of lumped rates by:
          1. evaluate the rate for each state on the subject level
          2. keep track of which subjects are in which states. use this to assign rates to each subject
          3. use the subject level rates to simulate the next event
          
          A. The issue is what happens when a subject can go into one of several states from his current state. One solution may be to store the rates and transition times in matrices with columns corresponding to the full number of transitions. The rate for transitions not reachable from the current state would then be 0. 

- Write a print method for epimodel

- Consider how to specify the initial distribution at t0. 

- Bookkeeping object for storing results. Should be separate from the primary bookkeeping object for memory reasons. Alternately, consider a method to write results to disk. Consult Vladimir.
