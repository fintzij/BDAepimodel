9/8/2015
================================
- Wrote test function for sim_one_event and slightly reworked init_obs_mat. 
- Tomorrow: function to simulate the data and update the obs_mat and dat objets. 

9/7/2015
================================
- Wrote function to be iterated in the simulation function: sim_one_event.
          + Need to write test functions for this.

9/4/2015
================================
- Deprecated subject level bookkeeping matrix in favor of a combined subject-level and population          -level bookeeping matrix. 


9/2/2015
================================
- Re-wrote rate extraction function to make rates available for use without a rate evaluation fcn. 
  + Rate functions always take their 'state' argument as a matrix, and their parameters argument as a vector. 
- Tomorrow: function to generate next event times. the function should inspect the current configuration and generate a new event time for each possible transition for each subject. Next event times should be stored as several vectors, or possibly as a matrix with impossible transitions recieving an Inf entry. 


General to-do:
================================

- Write a print method for epimodel

- Consider how to specify the initial distribution at t0. 

- Bookkeeping object for storing results. Should be separate from the primary bookkeeping object for memory reasons. Alternately, consider a method to write results to disk. Consult Vladimir.
